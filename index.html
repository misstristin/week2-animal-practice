    <h1>Goldfish are Rad</h1>
    <p>Goldfish are often thought of as dumb, ornamental, or even boring. But the truth is, goldfish are funny, interesting creatures that just want your attention like any pet.
        Some of goldfish's best characteristics include:
        <ul>
            <li>They can live for decades if you treat their water (home) correctly</li>
            <li>They recognize human faces up to 3 months later, according to the latest research.</li>
            <li>They are playful and can even be trained to do tricks!</li>
        </ul>
